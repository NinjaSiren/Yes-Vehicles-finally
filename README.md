[1.0] Yes, Vehicles, Finally! - A somewhat* new way to travel the planet!

I was searching for a mod of vehicles and it ended up me finding this old mod from B17 to B18. I ended up forking it from github and continuing the work of Mason J. Caboose's Yes, Vehicles mod.

Thank You Jecrell for making JecTools, Neronix for forking the Vehicle code from JecsTools (-O21-Vehicle Framework), and Mason J. Caboose for making the original WIP 
mod!

The mod requires the latest JecsTools by Jecrell:
https://github.com/jecrell/JecsTools/releases/

and -O21-Vehicle Framework by neronix17:
https://github.com/neronix17/-O21-Vehicle-Framework

Currently, Yes Vehicles Finally mod is at WIP, but will be always keep you posted if any
new things arise!
