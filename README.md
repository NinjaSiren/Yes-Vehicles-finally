[v0.83.4] [1.0] Yes, Vehicles, Finally! - A somewhat* new way to travel the planet!
with Combat Extended & Run and Gun support, with Faction AI addition!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was searching for a mod of vehicles and it ended up me finding this old mod from B17 to 
B18. I ended up forking it from github and continuing the work of Mason J. Caboose's Yes, 
Vehicles mod.

Thank You Jecrell for making JecsTools, Neronix for forking the Vehicle code from JecsTools 
([O21] Vehicle Framework), and Mason J. Caboose for making the original WIP mod!
Thank you for Hjkma/Taranchuk: https://github.com/Taranchuk for the Combat Extended patch Hotfix #2
and Weapons Balancing patch!

How does it work?

To acquire a vehicle you need to research Machining and Smithing and then you will be able to build the Vehicle Table. With it you can construct a box filled with vehicular pieces, and vehicle weapons.

To assemble the vehicle, instruct a pawn to follow the included manual in the box (right-click the box). Upon following guides 1-Z on your Ikea manual and throwing away the last 5 screws, your pawn will have successfully assembled a working scrap heap!

Upon assigning a driver, you must instruct the vehicle to draft itself for glorious duty. Just like any partially oiled machine, youâ€™ll have to fill and power it with chemfuel!

You will need both a driver and a gunner to shoot from the vehicle. Only the burst cannon, and machine cannon fits on the APC, and Machine Gun fits only with the Truck and ATV. (visually buggy yet, but works)

Reloading/loading CE ammo to your vehicle weapon of choice is done by:
First knowing what ammo the weapon, then install the weapon on to your vehicle of choice.
Right click the vehicle then select reload.
Make sure you got enough ammo for it.

When doing a caravan with a vehicle, make sure you include one colonist outside the vehicle to not get the "Downed Colonist" feature/issue from the Vehicle Framework[/size]

You got 5 vehicles currently in the mod:
Tank
APC
Truck
ATV
Cart

With 7 types of vehicular weapons:
Rail Cannon
Tank Cannon
Artillery Cannon
Naval Cannon
Burst Cannon
Machine Cannon
Machine Gun

And make sure you got alot of Steel, Component, and Plasteel in your inventory to craft the vehicles and weapons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:
Make sure that you have JecsTools and -O21-Vehicle Framework installed.
Extract and copy the contents in the Mods folder.

This mod is compatible with existing saves, it does not require you to start a new game.
The Vehicles Mod requires the JecsTools Library and the [O21] Vehicle Framework in order to work.
