[v0.8b2] [1.0+] Yes, Vehicles, Finally! - A somewhat* new way to travel the planet!
with Combat Extended & Run and Gun support, with Faction AI addition!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was searching for a mod of vehicles and it ended up me finding this old mod from B17 to 
B18. I ended up forking it from github and continuing the work of Mason J. Caboose's Yes, 
Vehicles mod.

Thank You Jecrell for making JecsTools, Neronix for forking the Vehicle code from JecsTools 
([O21] Vehicle Framework), and Mason J. Caboose for making the original WIP mod!
Thank you for Hjkma (#Taranchuk) for the Combat Extended patch Hotfix #2!
