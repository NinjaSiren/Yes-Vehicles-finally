[1.0] Yes, Vehicles, Finally! - A somewhat* new way to travel the planet!

I was searching for a mod of vehicles and it ended up me finding this old mod from B17 to B18. I ended up forking it from github and continuing the work of Mason J. Caboose's Yes, Vehicles mod.

The mod requires the latest JecTools to run as some dependencies are requiring Jecrell's tools.

Currently, Yes Vehicles Finally mod is at WIP as there is a serious bug that disables the bug because of a System.NullReferenceException caused at Rimworld.ThingDefGenerator_Corpses.CalculateMarketValue.

Changelogs:
v0.1
- Updating some Verse and Core references from B17/18 to v1.0+ variants, to remove some errors on the log file.
- Fixed some XML duplicate errors.
- Fixed the 3 default vehicles. (Truck, APC, and Tank).

v0.3
- Fixed serious bug Rimworld.ThingDefGenerator_Corpses.CalculateMarketValue (Verse.ThingDef raceDef).
- Fixed visual bugs.
- Weapons not operable yet while in vehicles.
