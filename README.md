I was searching for a mod of vehicles and it ended up me finding this old mod from B17 to B18. I ended up forking it from github and continuing the work of Mason J. Caboose's Yes, Vehicles mod.

Thank You Jecrell for making JecsTools, Neronix for forking the Vehicle code from JecsTools ([O21] Vehicle Framework), and Mason J. Caboose for making the original WIP mod! Thank you for Hjkma/Taranchuk for the Combat Extended patch Hotfix #2 and Weapons Balancing patch!
