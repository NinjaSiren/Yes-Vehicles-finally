        A true implementation of vehicles into RimWorld!
    
        First off, a big thank you to Jecrell and Neronix, without him none of you would have this!
    
        Second thing, thank you to Mason J. Caboose for making the original mod! I really wanted vehicles in the game, I ended up continuing this mod!
    
        This mod is a 'simple' implementation of a truck into our lovely rim world, you can load crew, passengers, turrets, and equipment for both crossing the map and for caravanning.
    
        To acquire a vehicle you need to research Machining and Smithing for the Vehicle Table. Here you can construct a box filled with appropriately named pieces.
        After following guides 1-Z on your ikea manual and throwing away the last 5 screws your pawn will have succesfully assembled a working scrap heap!
    
        Just like any partially oiled machine, youll have to fill and power it with Chemfuel! (not included)
    
        Upon assigning a driver, you must instruct the vehicle to draft itself for glorious duty.
    
        ==Notes and Help==
    
        - If your goal is caravanning, please put a driver at least with good mood and no needs.
        - New Game Required. (Old saves without this mod will break.)
        - No one else should show up on your door with any of this stuff.
        - You need both a gunner and a driver to fight.
        - Only the machine gun turret fits on the Truck and ATV.
        - Bugs is possibly be plenty in this mod, but hopefully that it woudn't to break your game!
		
		==Version changelog==
		
		- Added vehicle flammability values. (Vehicles can now burn!)
		- Added randomly exploding vehicles when damaged. (Military-grade vehicles are less likely to explode.)
